# CONTRIBUTING

We need to be nimble and ship fast given where we are, but we also want to make sure that contributors like you get as smooth an experience at contributing as possible. We've assembled this contribution guide for that purpose, aiming at getting you familiarized with the codebase & how we work with contributors, so you could quickly jump to the fun part.

This guide, like Dify itself, is a constant work in progress. We highly appreciate your understanding if at times it lags behind the actual project, and welcome any feedback for us to improve.

Looking for something to tackle? Browse our [good first issues](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22) and pick one to get started!
Got a cool new model runtime or tool to add? Open a PR in our [plugin repo](https://github.com/langgenius/dify-plugins) and show us what you've built.

Join the fun, contribute, and let's build something awesome together!

```javascript
// 用户输入用户名和密码
const username = prompt("请输入用户名");

// 校验用户名和密码
  // 假设有一个存储用户名和密码的数组
    { username: "admin", password: "admin123" },

  const user = users.find(u => u.username === username && u.password === password);
  if (user) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
}

// 校验是否为管理员
function isAdmin(user) {
  // 假设管理员的用户名是 "admin"
  return user.username === "admin";
}

// 登录
if (validateCredentials(username, password)) {
  if (isAdmin({ username: username })) {
    console.log("登录成功，欢迎管理员！");
    console.log("登录成功，欢迎普通用户！");
  }
} else {
  console.log("用户名或密码错误，请重试！");
}
